                        You might be asking, <strong>“Why do I need to learn coding just to build a website? Aren’t there platforms where I can drag and drop components and have a website ready in minutes?”</strong>
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Absolutely—those platforms exist, and they’re incredibly useful. But this course isn’t just about building simple websites.
                      </p>

                      <h3 className="bold">This is about unlocking a skill that goes far beyond templates and visual editors.</h3>

                      <p>
                        It’s about understanding how technology works from the inside out. It’s a stepping stone into the vast world of tech—software development, automation, artificial intelligence, app creation, and digital problem-solving.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Learning to code is like learning how to think differently. It equips you with problem-solving tools that will be relevant whether you're building a blog, launching a startup, analyzing data, or even writing legal tech tools.

                      <blockquote>
                        “I think everybody should learn how to program a computer and learn computer language. Because it teaches you how to think in a certain way.”
                      </blockquote>

                      <h5>Bill Gates (Founder, Microsoft)</h5>
                      <blockquote>
                        “Programming is where you are describing to the machine how to do something—telling it how to play tic-tac-toe, how to play the board game Monopoly, how to convert numbers from one base to another. The fact of understanding how the computer works gives you a real sense of what it can do and what it can't do.”
                      </blockquote>

                      <p>
                        If you’ve ever used a smartphone, computer, or even a smartwatch, then you’ve already touched the surface of what tech can do.
                        But if you really want to understand <strong>what’s under the hood</strong>, and how these tools are made—<strong>coding is your gateway.</strong>

                      <h5>Mark Zuckerberg (Co-founder & CEO, Facebook)</h5>
                      <blockquote>
                        “Programming is one of the only things in the world that you can do where you can sit down and just make something completely new from scratch.”
                      </blockquote>

                      <p>
                        And guess what? In this course, you’ll learn how to build from scratch—even while lying on your back (literally).<br></br>
                        But hey, if you’ve signed a lifelong deal with Mr. Sleep, maybe it's time to renegotiate—just for a while.

                      <h5>Ali Partovi (Entrepreneur & Investor)</h5>
                      <blockquote>
                        “For a few, learning a computer program might lead to a lucrative career as so-called coders. But for everybody, it will teach them how to think.”
                      </blockquote>

                      <p>
                        People are waking up. The future is arriving faster than you think. 
                        And trust me—you don’t want to be left behind when it fully lands.

                        So don’t wait. Take this opportunity seriously. Equip yourself with coding skills while you still can. Because this isn’t just about building websites—<br></br>
