                        <h3>HTML – The Structure</h3>

                        <img src={htmlCar} alt="HTML Car" />

                        <p>
                            Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the foundation of every web page. 
                            Think of it like the skeleton of a car, as shown in the first image above.
                            Without the skeleton, there's no place to attach the tires, brake lights, or engine.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Similarly, HTML creates the framework of a web page—it defines what shows up and where.
                            But just like no one wants to drive around in a bare metal frame, a plain HTML page isn’t 
                            very attractive. That’s where CSS comes in.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Example: Output of HTML without CSS</h4>
                        <p>Click <i><b>"Run code"</b></i> to display output</p>

                        <CodeBox 
                            id='htmlCode1'
                            lang='HTML'
                            outputImg={htmlOutput1}
                        >
                            <img src={htmlCode1} alt="" />
                        </CodeBox>

                        <hr />

                        <h3>CSS – The Styling</h3>

                        <img src={cssCar} alt="CSS Car" />

                        <p>
                            Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) gives life and beauty to the structure created by HTML. 
                            It’s like painting the car, installing leather seats, and adding those sleek headlights.
                        </p>
                        {/* <p>
                            The second image shows what styling can do. Both pictures have the same HTML, 
                            but their appearances are entirely different—all thanks to CSS.
                        </p> */}
                        <p>
                            So if HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the beauty and polish that make everything visually appealing.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Example:</h4>
                        <p>Click <i><b>"Run code"</b></i> to display output</p>
                        
                        <CodeBox 
                            id='htmlCode1'
                            lang='HTML'
                            outputImg={cssOutput1}
                        >
                            <img src={cssCode1} alt="" />
                        </CodeBox>

                        <hr />

                        <h3>JavaScript – The Interactivity</h3>

                        <img src={jsCar} alt="JavaScript Car" />

                        <p>
                            Now that your car looks beautiful, how should it function? Want to open the door with a button 
                            or remote? Make it automatic or manual? That’s the role of JavaScript.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript makes websites interactive and responsive to user actions—clicking buttons, 
                            submitting forms, triggering animations, and more.
                        </p>
                        <h3 className="bold">
                            In short, every modern website you visit is built using <strong>HTML</strong> for structure, 
                            <strong>CSS</strong> for design, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> for interactivity—all working 
                            together in harmony inside your browser.
